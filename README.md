## Welcome to Lydia B30 Tech Project

I created a one minute beat using Logic pro x loops, with these loops i made them longer, split them, cut them and mixed them, i also used 2 synths to help bring the loops together. In this lesson there was alot of key commands that i was taught which made it easier for me to find shortcuts. With the loops you can extend the loop by highlighting the loop you want and clicking "L" or you can open the loop menu bar by clicking "O" and there are many more. It is hard to remember all of these shortcuts at once but in time it becomes a easy habit of using.

  In this screenshot this shows my the first three loops and the mixer bar, the mixer bar is there you can edit the sound of the loops and change speed and even choose where you want to hear the sound more using the pan. The mixer is alot of help to bringing the sounds together as one.

  This second screenshot is where I inserted the two synths and then broke them down into two parts to correspond with eachother, this helps the loops come together even more by giving it melody.

 Here is where i learned such an awesome trick to help cut my tracks, zooming into the track and editing parts of it thats necessary, by doing this you can see each wave form more better in order to help break it or create another bar more smoothly.

  To make the loops not feel as if they keep repeating it was time to throw in another loop. im this case a piano loop that matched with the other loops, this loop broke the other three loops in a 4 second break to make the listeners more interested in the creativity of the tracks then all the loops played as one and there was a softer side to the song in the end.

  This is the finished touch of the whole one minute song where I learned basic commands and took several loops to make it from a sound into a beat. This was easy to do once I was able to know where everything was in Logic pro x and it helped me better understand what can be used and what can not be used to make sounds more enhanced.

My tip is to make sure your icon matches the name, you may become confused if your icon is a guitar but the name is a drum then you will not know what the sound is and you become unorganized. To change the name double click on the current name and type in the new name, then you can click "tab" to move onto the next name to change. To change the icon press "control" then click and a pop up should appear, there you will find the different icons and find the one that best matches with the name.
